Business Problem: Challenges & Opportunities

Avanade is focused on developing a compelling, client-centric digital experience. The company has an internal application for their employees called Template Lab. The application offers several templates. Users can utilize Template Lab to obtain content in the Avanade language for publication. This can be used to send birthday and anniversary wishes to employees as well as marketing and customer emails. However, users were facing trouble with the selection and modification of the appropriate template.

Solution Overview: How did Teams Help

Avanade is hard pivoting to AI and copilot-based solutions while concentrating on Microsoft solutions. Since Avanade started leveraging M365 Copilot for their users, they wanted to build a plugin called Brand Asset, specifically for the customer to add this functionality to M365 Copilot. Users would benefit from this M365 Copilot plugin for Teams in terms of discovery, and M365 Copilot would be able to modify the template to create what the user requests by modifying the template. The Brand Asset plugin allows users to request images, media, templates, and other creative assets to be used in presentations and internal communications. Instead of browsing to the brand central website, users can search for generated assets as part of a workflow and daisy chain event topics using the Brand Asset plugin.

Highlights & Learnings

Avanade's M365 Copilot plugin, Brand Asset, aids 5,000 users, integrating with Template Lab for branded social media assets. The M365 Copilot plugin for Teams is currently in production, having completed a pilot phase, and has been deployed in the customer’s environment for the first set of field users. Users have expressed that the LOB application provides a convenient and efficient means of accessing information, thereby opening a plethora of new ideas on how to use Copilot extensibility. The company increased the usage and discoverability of the application, resulting in a faster turnaround time for creating content as well as churning out marketing material. The TOL and CPM teams collaborated with Avanade to develop a message extension and integrate it with the Copilot plugin.

Business Problem: Challenges & Opportunities

Many organizations struggle to track, interpret, and make sense of the vast amount of data required to maintain and grow the business and comply with tax regulations. The EY Tax Technology and Transformation teams have this daunting task ahead of them. With thousands of clients, thousands of projects, and data stored in silos throughout complex organizations, EY depends on experience and technology to produce insightful analysis that enables its clients to thrive in the rapidly evolving business landscape of today. The first step in generating those insights is to consolidate data from many sources and geographic areas into a single, unified view. Historically, EY executives had to wait for data to be cleaned up, stored in a single place, and then pulled into a Power BI report. That process could take a week or two, so by the time the data was ready, it was already at least two weeks old. Because tax departments are usually the last users of all the data that’s generated, they are the ones that find errors. If an error was found, the data had to be sent back to the originator to find the source of the issue, rectify it, and resend the data, creating more delay. EY was continually seeking mechanisms to streamline the process in order to reduce turnaround time and frustration. It has recently begun to focus on how new, generative, AI-driven technologies might expedite the process.

Solution Overview: How did Teams Help

The Microsoft Teams and M365 Copilot product teams extended an invitation to the EY Tax team to preview the new features as part of their cooperative relationship with Microsoft Teams Ecosystem Engineering. The goal was to identify how the EY Tax team could implement generative AI technology throughout the whole organization. EY reinvented the work experience for its senior leaders by collaborating with Microsoft Teams Ecosystem Engineering to create a plugin for Microsoft 365 Copilot. This plugin seamlessly extends M365 Copilot by leveraging Microsoft Graph Connectors and EY's proprietary data to bridge connections and insights across various business disciplines while leveraging the built-in security into the Microsoft platform. EY leaders can prompt M365 Copilot for critical business insights including: What is the net unbilled invoices for the last 120 days Find me NUI for last 105 days and group them by partner Please give me NUI for the last 6 months for partner David, Alicia User Experience

Highlights & Learnings

Microsoft Teams and M365 Copilot invited the EY Tax team to preview M365 Copilot extensibility. The goal was to determine how the EY Tax team could implement generative AI technology across the organization. The executives now have the power of real-time business insights, through simple, natural-language queries in M365 Copilot. M365 Copilot, having the company’s DNA embedded in it, can seamlessly comprehend, and speak the required language. Just by prompting M365 Copilot, EY executives can quickly assess where to focus attention, whether on billing and collections, the health of engagement economics, the utilization of people according to their skill sets, hiring decisions, or the next big client initiative. Depending on the results, users can generate tasks such as creating report drafts, schedules, follow-up meetings, and email communications. With M365 Copilot, tasks that often required many junior associate days can be finished in a matter of seconds. This solution enables EY to communicate with their data. With strong sponsorship from EY’s Tax Transformation Team including the Global Vice Chair of Tax, Microsoft Teams Ecosystem Engineering worked closely with EY to quickly develop the data insights plugin.
